Not even half a year later, in May 2019, after realizing that people also wanted to involve (virtual) money in their challenges, a wallet system was added to that website, and VelvetCuff was created.<br><br> Since then, it evolved a lot, getting its' own website, a bot, casino games, and even if there's been some ups and downs along the way, I can honestly say that the VC season 2 release is one of my proudest achievements.<br> For the first time, I was happy with what I had made, enjoying playing the game myself, and seeing people interact with it daily, it was more important than anything to me.<br> New connections were made, new partners, new friends, with crazy stories from your perverted minds shared for everyone to read.<br><br> I'm going to miss it, that's for sure. I'm sure some of you will as well, but it is time to say goodbye.<br> "Licked butts, had fun, didn't cheat, loved our members, changed my life forever."<br> If you want to keep in touch, I'm reachable at [elise.pariat at erot.ca] or Elise Pariat on F-list.<br> It was fun playing with you all, but I'm sure we'll meet again in DMs... somewhere! F-list, Discord, or else, who knows.<br><br> Elise / Aelith<br><br><br> PS: Below is a post-mortem. I don't expect anyone to read it, but you'll get some extra details for why it's closing.<br><br> On a technical aspect:<br> - The website, bot and games will assuredly break with the imminent release of F-list 2.0 (beta).<br> - Even if obviously possible, I unfortunately do not have the drive to pour a lot of time to fix the website's code when it happens.<br> - I would much rather work with new stuff than having to maintain a half-broken legacy system forever.<br> <br><br> These technical things aren't the sole reason why it's stopping.<br> The next few points are about the community as a whole, it is much more personal but I'd rather be transparent it all, you'll understand why at the end:<br> - I haven't always taken the best decisions throughout VC's lifespan, even if most of these weren't intentional. Even if VC wasn't a real business, you'll always make mistakes even running a fake one, this is no exception. Live and learn.<br> - I've accepted profiles and players of low quality not to offend people, not realizing that lowering the quality bar would also mean lowering the community's quality and driving people away from it.<br> - I've accepted behaviors that are ruining immersion, role-playing and fairness, not thinking that it'd slowly erode the game as a whole.<br> - I've been too kind and sometimes too harsh with some bans. I have never banned someone who didn't deserve it in the first place, but there are some who deserve a second chance.<br> - F-List has gotten very toxic over the years, and this is coming from someone that used to deal with domme-breakers daily. So many bad profiles, bad-mannered partners, ghosting galore, a single misstep in RP is a death sentence. Chill, people, chill.<br> - I have lost trust in F-list as a whole, and I am not ready to spend months of development only to get banned for having 4 pixels of a dog in a picture taken from instagram. (or whatever stupid thing I was warned for last time)<br> <br><br> For the game itself: <br> - Sometimes, the balance of the game was off, meaning the game rewards were more important than the RP aspect, which defeats the point of the website.<br> - The economy has never really taken the shape I wanted it to take, and that's a difficult task to achieve without being an Econ major.<br> - Many features are broken or badly implemented: leaderboards, cuffr, searches, item creation tool, relationships and so many more.<br> - The core features are working, but they would seriously need a complete makeover. The UX is... bearable.<br> - The multi-character system on the website just sucks. So many features are not immersive because of it, and it's annoying to deal with both for me and the users.<br> <br><br> Now, why did I say all that?<br> Because these are pain points I want to try and fix on my next personal side-project: a semi-private ERP platform/game.<br> Personal is a big keyword. It will _not_ be linked to F-list, and will not compete with F-list.<br> It will not be publicly available (at first, maybe ever).<br> I want to take everything that made VC a success, package it in a much better product, letting people I trust, aka friends and friend of friends at the moment, have a safe, comfortable and immersive platform to use.<br> There is no ETA, no roadmap, no ambitions or expectations set, since I'm treating it like a personal side-project.<br> This is what I'll be working on! If you'd like to hear more, feel free to shoot me a note or e-mail, but if you're someone I talk to regularly and trust, you've most likely already heard about that project already (and I probably was annoying about it).<br><br> That's all for now folks!<br> Thanks for reading until the end, feel free to contact me anytime/anywhere if you wanna send me some feedback, insults, or kind wishes.</p><p>&mdash;VelvetCuff (2019-2025)</p></div></article></body>
